## About Me

I’m **Cynthia Osarumwense Udoh**, a community-focused, impact-driven professional who found her way into tech during a time of uncertainty (thanks, COVID). I come from a Medical background, but today, I thrive in **community operations**, **tech writing**, **event management**, and **newsletter creation**.

For the past few years, I’ve been working in tech, mostly helping online communities grow, writing newsletters, and planning both virtual and physical events. I’ve written all kinds of content: updates, blog posts, recaps, and social media copy. But lately, I’ve realized there’s a whole other layer to **technical writing**, and that’s exactly what I’m now pursuing with intention.

### How I Started

In **December 2020**, while stuck at home doing endless chores (if you grew up in a Nigerian home, you get it), I stumbled across a link to a 12-week **AWS Cloud Practitioner Bootcamp**. That changed everything.

- I attended.  
- I studied hard.  
- I passed the certification exam.  
- Most importantly, I **found direction**.

### Why Technical Writing?

I **WriteTech Hub** technical writing bootcamp because I want to learn how to **explain technical topics in a clear, simple, and helpful way**, not just for those already in tech, but also for people who are new and trying to understand how things work.

I want to:

- Learn how professional technical writers think, write, and structure content.  
- Understand the tools and processes behind great documentation.  
- Contribute more confidently and meaningfully to open-source projects, especially through documentation.  
- Eventually pass that knowledge on to others, because if something I write can help someone accomplish a task, then I’ve done something right.

At the heart of it, I just want to get better at something I already enjoy: writing things that make sense, help people, and don’t leave anyone confused.

### Fun Fact

I never planned to be in tech. I just needed a break from cooking and doing other housework in December 2020. One random link changed everything.
